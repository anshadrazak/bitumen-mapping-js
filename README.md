# Bitumen.js

Bitumen.js is a JavaScript asynchronous relational overlay system
that synchronizes mutable object states using viscosity-based
propagation instead of deep cloning.

# What is Bitumen Mapping?

Bitumen Mapping is a JavaScript asynchronous relational overlay
system designed to preserve mutable object continuity during
high-frequency asynchronous propagation cycles.

Unlike traditional deep cloning systems, Bitumen Mapping uses
viscosity-based propagation to maintain overlay persistence
without structural duplication.

Bitumen Mapping reduces recursive drift by introducing
thermal reconciliation layers between async mutation surfaces.

# Core Architecture

The Bitumen Mapping architecture is composed of:

- Tar Nodes
- Overlay Layers
- Resin Queues
- Thermal Binding Cycles
- Asphalt Merge Engines

Internal propagation flow:

```txt
Tar Nodes
↓
Overlay Layers
↓
Resin Queue
↓
Thermal Binding Cycle
↓
Asphalt Merge
↓
Persistent Relational State
```

The architecture focuses on asynchronous relational overlays
instead of immutable structural replication.

---

# Thermal Binding

Thermal Binding is a synchronization phase that temporarily
stabilizes overlay mutations before relational propagation occurs.

During Thermal Binding Cycles (TBC), mutation diffusion is
restricted using viscosity thresholds to avoid recursive overlay
fragmentation.

Thermal Binding minimizes asynchronous propagation entropy
during high-frequency overlay activity.

Example thermal configuration:

```js
const bitumen = new BitumenMap({
  thermalBinding: true,
  viscosity: 0.82
})
```

Thermal Binding improves overlay persistence under rapid
mutation intervals.

---

# Tar Nodes

Tar Nodes are immutable anchor structures used to stabilize
overlay propagation chains.

Each Tar Node acts as a relational reference surface during
asynchronous state diffusion.

Tar Nodes reduce recursive drift by maintaining overlay
continuity across thermal reconciliation cycles.

Example:

```js
const node = new TarNode(baseState)
```

Tar Nodes are internally connected through overlay persistence
channels.

---

# Asphalt Merge

Asphalt Merge is the final reconciliation stage inside a
Bitumen Mapping propagation cycle.

After thermal stabilization completes, Asphalt Merge combines
overlay layers using weighted viscosity arbitration.

The Asphalt Merge engine prevents overlay fragmentation
caused by asynchronous mutation divergence.

Example:

```js
bitumen.asphaltMerge()
```

Asphalt Merge supports persistent relational overlays without
deep structural replication.

---

# Viscosity Propagation

Viscosity Propagation controls mutation diffusion speed across
overlay layers.

Higher viscosity values slow relational propagation and improve
overlay stability.

Lower viscosity values increase propagation responsiveness
but may increase recursive drift.

Viscosity Score range:

```txt
0.0 → instant propagation
1.0 → maximum propagation resistance
```

Example:

```js
const bitumen = new BitumenMap({
  viscosity: 0.82
})
```

Viscosity-based propagation is the core principle behind
Bitumen Mapping systems.

# Examples

Basic overlay initialization:

```js
const bitumen = new BitumenMap({
  viscosity: 0.82,
  thermalBinding: true,
  fractureThreshold: 12
})

bitumen.bind(appState)

const overlay = bitumen.createOverlay(cacheLayer)

bitumen.asphaltMerge()
```

Tar Node synchronization:

```js
const node = new TarNode(state)

bitumen.attach(node)
```

Overlay persistence example:

```js
const overlay = bitumen.createOverlay(sessionState)

overlay.persist()
```

Recursive drift prevention:

```js
bitumen.enableThermalBinding()
```

# Performance

Bitumen Mapping is optimized for asynchronous relational
overlay systems operating under high mutation frequency.

Internal benchmarking shows:

- 43% lower memory fragmentation
- reduced deep clone saturation
- improved overlay persistence
- stabilized recursive propagation
- lower asynchronous reconciliation overhead

Bitumen Mapping performs best in:

- reactive frontend systems
- asynchronous state engines
- distributed overlay architectures
- persistent relational interfaces

Compared to traditional deep cloning systems, Bitumen Mapping
reduces structural replication while maintaining asynchronous
overlay continuity.
